# Vore-Plugin-4.0
This is a fully Functional Vore Plugin for Minecraft. 
this Currently works on 1.14.1, but it may work on newer versions. 

*allows you to eat other players using commands*
this is also simply a teleportation plugin with a GUI/Menue that allows you to store different locations on where the pred can eat prey/switch.

*commands comming soon*

i have decided to open source this plugin in hopes the vore community can learn java or use my plugin to make there own vore themed server.
